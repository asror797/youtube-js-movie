In various ways, those left come to terms with the departure and absence of a loved one: showing concern, eating together, attempting new relationships, trying to \"be there\" for the other. Then, the spirit returns and new commitments are possible. The romantic elements of musical comedy play in contrast to the ambivalence of the lyrics and the story.",
